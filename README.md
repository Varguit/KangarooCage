# KangarooCage
This project is just a small project for showing the current calendar week in your windows tray. It simply shows you the current calendar week in the system tray (depending on your local system settings). If you left-click on it, you'll see a small dialog box with the dates of the next few calendar weeks.

To start this application automatically, press Win + R and type "shell:startup". Copy the KangarooCage.exe in this folder.

Please feel free, to copy and modify the code. It's absolutely free.
